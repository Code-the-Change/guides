This repository hosts guides on aspects of programming and project work that
we have found useful to learn about. The source files here are human-readable,
but they look much prettier when built by Sphinx. The built HTML is hosted
by `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.io>`_ and available at
https://stanford-code-the-change-guides.readthedocs.io.
