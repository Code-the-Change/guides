Guide to Slack Notifications
============================

Slack notifications can be annoying to work with because Slack silences
many notifications by default. This guide will walk you through how to
change these settings.

-----------------------------------
Activating Notifications on Desktop
-----------------------------------

You will need to have the Slack app installed on your computer. You can
download it `here <https://slack.com/get>`_.

For MacOS
=========

#. Open the Code the Change workspace from the left sidebar.
#. Select the title bar at the top of the left panel. The title should
   read ``Code the Change``. The title is outlined in red in this image
   
   |desktop1|

#. In the drop-down menu that appears, select ``Preferences``, outlined
   in red here
   
   |desktop2|

#. In the preferences window that appears, under ``Notify me about``,
   choose ``All new messages``, outlined in red here

   |desktop3|
